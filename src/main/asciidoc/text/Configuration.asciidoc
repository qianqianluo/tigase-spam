To enable default set of SPAM filters with default settings you need to enable SessionManager processor +spam-filter+:

.Enabling default SPAM filters
[source,properties]
----
'sess-man () {
    'spam-filter' () {}
}

== Changing active SPAM filters
You can configure active SPAM filters by setting enabling and disabling SPAM filters (subbeans of +spam-filter+ processor bean).

.Enabling +message-same-long-body+ filter
[source,dsl]
----
'sess-man' () {
    'spam-filter' () {
        'message-same-long-body' () {}
    }
}

== Sending error when packet is dropped
By default, due to nature of SPAM, you do not want to send error packet when SPAM packet is dropped as sending error back will:

* increase traffic on a server (which in rare cases may lead to overload of a XMPP server)
* notify spammer that it was not possible to delivery message

It is possible to configure +spam-filter+ to send error back, by setting +true+ to +spam-filter+ +return-error+ property:

.Allow sending error
[source,properties]
----
'sess-man () {
    'spam-filter' () {
        return-error = true
    }
}
----

== Enabling logging of dropped messages
It is possible to enable logging of dropped messages by adding `spam` to comma separate list of values for `--debug` property.
