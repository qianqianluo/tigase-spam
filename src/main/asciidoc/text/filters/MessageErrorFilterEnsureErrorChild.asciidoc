Some of SPAM messages are sent as stanzas which are invalid if we compare them with XMPP specification, ie. `<message/>` stanza with `type` attribute set to `error` are sent without child element `<error/>` which is required for all packets of type `error`.
This filter detects this kind of messages and marks them as SPAM.

This filter is identified by following id `message-error-ensure-error-child`.
