Presence subscription filter
--------------------------------

When there is a presence-based SPAM being sent using XMPP server in most cases there is a lot of ``presence`` of type ``subscribe`` being sent from the single JID. This behavior is annoying and has negative impact on the XMPP server as according to the XMPP specification each ``presence`` of type ``subscribe`` sent from JID which is not in the users roster causes adding this JID to the userâ€™s roster until user declines subscription request.

Detection is based on counting subscription request being sent from the same bare JID within a period of time.

Below is list of possible settings which may be modified to adjust this filter behaviour.

Number of allowed subscription requests per minute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Be default filter allows 5 subscription requests to be sent from the single JID per minute. If some client will send more than 5 subscription requests it will be marked as a spammer.

**Setting filter to allow 7 subscription requests per minute.**

.. code:: dsl

   'sess-man' () {
       'spam-filter' () {
           'presence-subcribe' () {
               'limit-per-minute' = 7
           }
       }
   }
